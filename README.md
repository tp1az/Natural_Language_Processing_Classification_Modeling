Project Overview

This project implements a text classification model to distinguish between simple and complex words. The classification task is a step toward automated text simplification, which can help improve readability for younger readers, English learners, and individuals with learning disabilities. The project explores various machine learning techniques, evaluates models using precision, recall, and F1-score, and allows for the development of a custom classifier.
